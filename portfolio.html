<p> This is my project! through python and turtle code, using while loop, we made a snowglobe with a house and two snowman. <p/>
<p>On the house has a wreath that changes color, every second. This code required drawing half cicrles and color fills, <p/>
	<p>althrough which we learned in the first unit. <p/>

<p> This is my second project! through python and turtle code, using while loop, global statments and functions we created a new game very similra to PacMan. <p/>
<p> Using collision code the pacman, or turtle can run into fruits to gain points and can run into the ghost to lose the game. With the leaderboard we made, <p/>
	<p> we can see who is in the lead and is the best at this game. <p/>

<p> This is our third project of the course. This was another game that we produced that is called penguslide! This is a game where our chararcter Pengu must <p/>
<p> travel down a snowy mountain and avoid obstacles in its way. The way it works is using collision variables we made it so that whenever our character hit <p/>
<p> an object, that was coming near it, the game ended and you recieved your score right away. <p/>
<p> Its very tricky <p/>
